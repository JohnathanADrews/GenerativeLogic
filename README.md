# Generative Mechanical Logic

Generative Mechanical Logic (or Generative Logic or GL) is a purely mechanical logical system that is meant to build mathematics from scratch using bits, binary operators, and other stuctures such as recursive functions and recursion systems. Using this approach, we can analyze mathematics more generally, and without the need for axioms. Mathematics deals with numerical values, which is why axioms are required. Using bits, on the other hand, gives us access to the raw information so we can see what is going on behind the scenes in a numerical system. Please see the About.txt file for a conceptual overview about how it works.

The code included in this project is a Hularion Experience application. Please see the Hularion project (https://github.com/JohnathanADrews/Hularion) for details on how to run it. It is currently being updated from a previous version of Hularion Experience.
