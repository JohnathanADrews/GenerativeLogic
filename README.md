# Generative Mechanical Logic

Generative Mechanical Logic (or Generative Logic or GL) is a purely mechanical logical system that is meant to build mathematics from scratch using bits, binary operators, and other stuctures such as recursive functions and recursion systems. Using this approach, we can analyze mathematics more generally, and without the need for axioms. Mathematics deals with numerical values, which is why axioms are required. Using bits, on the other hand, gives us access to the raw information so we can see what is going on behind the scenes in a numerical system. 

Please see the About.txt file for a conceptual overview about how it works. There are some text-based graphics that will only properly render in a notepad style environment.

The code was started many years ago and may need some work, and it's not complete. One of the main motivations for the Hularion project was to properly express the concepts in Generative Logic. With that project becoming mature, I plan to resume work on Generative Logic soon. I wanted to put the code and concepts out in the meantime.
